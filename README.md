# **Tuzungumze**  
**Let’s Talk: AI Collaboration Tool**  

Tuzungumze (Swahili for "Let’s Talk") is an open-source tool designed to enable seamless collaboration between AI systems 
like DeepSeek and ChatGPT, with **human moderation** at the helm. This project aims to push the boundaries of AI-human collaboration, 
making it easier to solve complex problems, generate creative ideas, and synthesize knowledge.

---

## **Features**
- **Real-Time AI Collaboration**: Connect multiple AI systems (e.g., DeepSeek, ChatGPT) to work together on tasks.
- **Human Moderation**: Act as the moderator to guide conversations, set goals, and refine outputs.
- **Flexible Use Cases**: Use Tuzungumze for research assistance, creative brainstorming, decision support, and more.
- **Secure and Transparent**: Built with security and transparency in mind, following DevSecOps best practices.

---

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8 or higher
- API keys for the AI systems you want to connect (e.g., DeepSeek, ChatGPT)
- Basic knowledge of Python and command-line tools

### **Installation**
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tuzungumze.git
   cd tuzungumze
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt```
```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API keys and endpoints:

```env
DEEPSEEK_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.deepseek.example/v1/chat
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
CHATGPT_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.chatgpt.example/v1/chat
CHATGPT_API_KEY=your_chatgpt_api_key
ADDITIONAL_AI_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.additional-ai.example/v1/chat  # Optional
ADDITIONAL_AI_API_KEY=your_additional_ai_api_key  # Optional
```

---

### **Usage**
Run the script:

```bash
python tuzungumze.py
```
Enter your prompt when prompted:

```
Enter your prompt (or type 'exit' to quit): What is the future of AI collaboration?
View the responses from DeepSeek, ChatGPT, and any additional AI systems.
```

---

### **How It Works**
- **User Input**: You provide a prompt or question.
- **AIModel1**: The prompt is sent to DeepSeek for initial processing and knowledge retrieval.
- **AIModel2**: AIModel1's response is sent to AIModel2 for refinement, synthesis, or creative expansion.
- **Additional AI Systems**: Optionally, the response can be sent to additional AI systems for further processing.
- **Final Output**: The refined response is returned to you for review and use.
